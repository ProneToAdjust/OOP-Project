# OOP-Project

## About

Intended Learning Outcome (ILO):
1. Appreciate the beauty of CLI application
2. Apply the Java knowledge into the application
3. Experience Internet of Things (IoT), file input/output (I/O), and socket programming
(optional)
4. Experiment the software architecture design principles

Tasks:
By the end of the project, you should
1. Implement an ATM CLI application, with the listed fundamental features below,
2. Brainstorm advanced features with creative ideas,
3. Apply the course contents (e.g. abstract, interface, IoT HTTP call, etc) to the project,
4. Show the necessary best practice in Java, and general coding principle,
5. Present your work, which include the sections: features introduction (point form
with some explanations), programming highlights (indicate the number line of
code, what Java knowledge you applied and the feature), user interface highlight
(some screenshots with description), UML diagram, known issues (e.g. known bugs,
limitation, assumption, etc), and future work.

Fundamental Features:
1. Account Information (e.g. how many accounts, account numbers, etc)
2. Balance Check (e.g. remain balance, available balance, etc)
3. Authentication (e.g. password check / reset, etc)
4. Money Transfer(e.g. inter-account transfer, third-party transfer, etc)
5. Settings (e.g. transfer limit, overseas withdraw limit, etc)
